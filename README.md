AI-Driven Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) Control Using Reinforcement Learning
AI-Driven RIS Control Using Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains an AI-driven implementation of RIS phase control using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DDPG) for dynamic 6G wireless environments.

The project includes:

RIS-assisted wireless environment modeling (with and without direct link)

DDPG-based continuous phase control

Closed-form analytical baseline and no-RIS baseline

Training behavior analysis and performance comparison

Evaluation using throughput, SNR, and outage metrics

The goal of this work is to explore when reinforcement learning is beneficial for RIS control, and where classical closed-form solutions remain optimal under ideal assumptions.

This repository represents the starting point of a series of RL-based implementations focused on practical, physics-aware AI for future 6G systems.
